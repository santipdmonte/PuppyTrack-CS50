#### Description:
PuppyTrack is an innovative web application designed to enhance the efficiency of veterinary clinics by providing separate sections for consultations and client reception. Our platform revolutionizes the traditional paper-based process, facilitating seamless online communication between veterinarians and receptionists.

I decided to create this application under the context that we are a veterinary clinic divided into the consultation area and the customer reception area with a secretary. A typical consultation follows the following steps: a client arrives, they are received and enter the consultation room, the veterinarian conducts the consultation, writes down the treatment performed and the necessary medications on paper, and hands it to the client, who later delivers it at the reception for payment.
With this application, we would be avoiding excessive use of paper and creating an online communication interface between the veterinarian and the secretary.

Vet Section:
In the Vet section of PuppyTrack, veterinarians can efficiently manage and document the treatments and medications administered to clients. This section includes the following key features:

Treatment and Medication Management: Veterinarians can easily input and record all the treatments and medications provided to their clients. PuppyTrack comes with a comprehensive database preloaded with a wide range of treatments and medications, each accompanied by suggested prices. The veterinarians also have the flexibility to modify these prices as needed.

Observations and Notes: Our platform allows veterinarians to attach specific observations and notes to each treatment or individual client. This feature enables veterinarians to provide personalized care and ensures accurate documentation of important details.

Document Generation: Once the consultation is complete, veterinarians can generate a comprehensive document that includes the details of all the treatments and medications administered. This document can be printed or emailed to the client, providing them with a clear record of their pet's care and any prescribed medications.

Front Section:
In the Front section of PuppyTrack, receptionists have access to a centralized platform that facilitates efficient client management and billing. This section includes the following key features:

Client Listing: Receptionists can view a comprehensive list of all clients who have been attended to. Each client entry includes their name and any relevant observations made by the veterinarian during the consultation.

Treatment and Medication Overview: PuppyTrack provides receptionists with a clear overview of the treatments and medications administered to each client. This includes the name of the treatment or medication, the unit price, and the total amount due for each item. This feature streamlines the billing process and ensures accurate and transparent pricing.

By utilizing PuppyTrack, veterinary clinics can significantly reduce paper consumption, contributing to a more environmentally friendly approach. Our web app optimizes communication between veterinarians and receptionists, promoting a seamless workflow and enhancing the overall client experience.
